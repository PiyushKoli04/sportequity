## SportScore Formula

```
SportScore = (Performance × 0.4) + (Health × 0.2) + (Training × 0.3) + (Diet × 0.1)
```

- **Performance** — average training intensity × 1.25 (capped at 100)
- **Health** — starts at 100, deducted for high BMI or blood pressure
- **Training** — unique months of activity × 10 (capped at 100)
- **Diet** — 100 if avg daily calories 1800–2500, else 70

---

## Running Without MongoDB

The app detects when MongoDB is unavailable and automatically switches to an
**in-memory mock database**. All features work — data just resets on restart.
This is ideal for demos and testing.
